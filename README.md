## Overview

This project implements a **Character-Level Transformer Language Model** designed for generating text based on an input context. The model learns to predict the next character in a sequence, enabling the generation of coherent text one character at a time. By leveraging the transformer architecture, the model is highly effective in capturing long-range dependencies in textual data, making it a powerful tool for text generation tasks.

## Project Structure

- `Dataset_NLP.txt`: Input text file containing the dataset on which the model will be trained.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

---

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- NumPy

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch
```

---

## Hyperparameters

The model's behavior can be customized using several hyperparameters:

- `batch_size`: Number of sequences processed in each batch.
- `block_size`: Length of each training sequence.
- `n_embd`: Dimensionality of the character embeddings.
- `n_head`: Number of attention heads in the transformer.
- `n_layer`: Number of transformer layers.
- `learning_rate`: Step size for updating the modelâ€™s weights.

These hyperparameters are defined at the start of the script and can be modified to suit your specific dataset and task requirements.

## Model Architecture

The character-level transformer consists of:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts each character (from the vocabulary) into a fixed-dimensional embedding vector.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to the input embeddings to capture the order of characters.
- **Multi-head Self-Attention Layers**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the sequence when generating new characters, capturing long-range dependencies.
- **Feedforward Layers**: Apply non-linear transformations to the data after the self-attention layers.
- **Output Layer**: Produces a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary, representing the likelihood of each character being the next in the sequence.

## Text Generation

Once the model is trained, it can generate text based on an initial context (or seed) using the `generate()` function. This function predicts one character at a time and appends each prediction to the context to predict the next character.

### Example

To generate 100 new characters from an empty seed:

```python
context = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long, device=device)
print(decode(model.generate(context, max_new_tokens=100)[0].tolist()))
```

You can also provide an initial seed to the model and generate text based on that seed.

## Future Improvements

- **Word-Level Model**: Consider moving from character-level to word-level tokenization for larger datasets where word-level relationships are more important.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Train on domain-specific data to generate more coherent and topic-relevant text.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Use pre-trained transformer models (e.g., GPT-2) for fine-tuning on specific tasks for faster and more effective results.
